# twitter-sentiment
This is a research project wherein I analysed the sentiment of a movie to gather audience anticipation post and pre-release. I used Twitter api which could let me access a limited number of tweets in real time. I collected this data time and again so that after enough observations I could study the pattern of audience reactions.

**If you want to know what conclusions I made from this research, you can read my published paper over [_here._](http://www.ijraset.com/fileserve.php?FID=4634)**
